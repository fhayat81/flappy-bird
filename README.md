I have tried my best to make it responsive as much as possible however in the touch screen devices only the game is working unexpectedly. However when I am inspecting my browser and I am using my keyboard for controlling the game in mobile, tablets, etc., still its working fine. The problem is only with the touch input (TAP) and I am not able to find out the error in my code.
